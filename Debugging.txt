- Steps to debug
	- F9 -> Break Point
	- Set the Mode to Debug (Next to x86)
	- Run the Local windows Debugger

- Debugger
	- Yellow arrows shows which line is currently in execution.
	- Continue -> Continue our execution of the program

- Modes
	- Step Into -> F11 -> Step into a function on the current line
	- Step Over -> F10 -> Moves on to the next line of code but not going to execute the next line.
	- Step Out -> Shift + F11 -> Moves out the current function the line is getting executed in.
	- Example :
		int main()
		{
			Log("hello"); -> If our Break point is set here
			std::cout<<"a"<<std::endl;
		}
		
		- When we press step into -> Yellow arrow moves into the Log function declaration and execute the lines of code in the Log function.
		- When we press step Over -> Yellow arrow moves to the next line of code (i.e. std::cout<<"a"<<std::endl)		
		- When we press step Out -> Yellow arrows moves out the function -> Moves out of the int main()

- Disassembly mode -> Right click when in debug mode

- Memory View -> Top menu -> Debug -> Windows -> Memory -> Memory 1
	- To Check a variable in the memory just type in Address : &variablename
